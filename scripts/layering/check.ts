// Import-direction lint — enforces the folder DAG established by the Phase-5
// folder moves. The policies and their tests below are the source of truth.
//
// Ranked target spine, as rank groups lowest to highest. `A ◄ B` means B may not
// be outranked by A (the back-edge order the gate rejects), NOT that every displayed import exists:
//   { contracts, request, selectors, platforms } ◄ core ◄ { commands, cli-schema }
//         ◄ { client, daemon-server } ◄ daemon-client ◄ cli
// (authoritative ranks: `TARGET_DAG_RANK` in model.ts. The former rank-0 kernel
// zone lives in packages/kernel since #1490 W0; R11 owns its boundary.)
//
// This gate enforces five things, across four scopes:
//   - GLOBALLY, across every production source file: the R2-R3 move rules and
//     rejection of all production static value-import cycles (R4). R1 kernel-sink
//     retired with the kernel's move to packages/kernel (#1490 W0); R8
//     zero-dep-job-closure retired with the last `install-deps: false` job
//     (#1781 A6) — its invariant has no subjects, and both numbers are spent, so
//     a new rule takes the next free id rather than reusing them.
//   - Over the RANKED SPINE only: rejection of every spine back-edge (R5), i.e.
//     an import whose source zone outranks its target zone, plus a ratchet on the
//     same inversion measured over TYPE-ONLY edges (R6).
//   - Over the DAEMON only: SessionState field ownership (R7), because the session
//     record is store-owned mutable state that any daemon module can write; and the terminal
//     concrete-platform boundary (R65), which rejects every import form into src/platforms or a
//     platform package.
//   - Over the TYPE GRAPH: the largest type-level import cycle is pinned by
//     equality (R9). R4 keeps the value graph acyclic, so these cycles are free at
//     runtime but bound what can be read in isolation; growth fails, and so does a
//     baseline left above the measured size.
//   - Across the DAEMON MODULARITY MIGRATION: R7 ownership pressure and external
//     daemon/types.ts importers only shrink, R9 zone membership cannot grow or absorb
//     engine files, and planned logical modules start with zero forbidden/internal imports (R10).
//   - Over the WORKSPACE PACKAGES: no root back-imports, no relative tunnelling past
//     an exports map, and every workspace specifier declared + exports-named (R11).
//   - Over BIN.TS'S ALIAS RESOLUTION: it must delegate to the one alias registry instead of
//     re-declaring a parallel mapping of its own (R12) — the same "delegate to your single
//     owner" shape as R7's SessionState ownership, applied to bin.ts's `--help` fast path.
//   - Over PLATFORM PACKAGE COMPOSITION: six private metadata façades meet at the exact root
//     composition file; premature implementation loading and forbidden cross-boundary edges fail (R13).
//   - Over REQUEST-BOUND RUNTIME EXECUTION: facts remain the only admission authority and daemon
//     code cannot manufacture or repair a narrowed runtime proof (R66).
//   - Over CONTRACTS PRODUCTION SOURCE: contracts owns vocabulary only — host, process, and timer
//     mechanics belong in capture-kit or an adapter (R18).
// Only `(root)` is unranked among src/ zones (see `UNRANKED_ZONES` in model.ts):
// it holds entrypoints and composition roots. Extracted workspace package zones
// are classified separately and held behind R11 instead of the src folder spine.

//                                the client at runtime, only its type.
//
//   commands -> daemon-server (1)  `DaemonCommandRoute` is declared in core so descriptors can
//                                name a route without importing the daemon. `command-explain.ts`

 * The rules this guard runs. Registering one is writing a key here, which is why the list is data
 * rather than a hand-written array of spreads: an object cannot hold the same key twice, so a rule
 * cannot be run — and reported, and ::error-annotated — twice by a copy-paste. `LayeringRuleId`
 * then makes a missing key a type error rather than a silently retired rule.
 *
 * Order is the reporting order: report() groups by rule in first-seen order.
