// Per-entry eager-closure budgets -- the ADR-0019 loading-shape probe (#1739, #1960).
//
// ADR-0019's "Implementation-laziness" section requires platform-package façades to stay
// implementation-lazy and is explicit that a startup-time threshold alone is not a substitute for
// preserving the loading shape (`docs/adr/0019-request-bound-platform-runtime.md`): "the tracking
// issue owns the exact probe and planted-red procedure." #1950 built the AST-level walker
// (`eager-import-closure.fixtures.ts`); #1959/#1969 fixed two more instances of the regression
// class by hand. This table generalizes the proof: every package entry surface gets an exact pin
// on how many repo modules importing it evaluates, plus a standing assertion that the closure
// never reaches a concrete platform implementation before discovery/binding selects one.
//
// The six `packages/platform-*/src/index.ts` façades are the reason this gate exists. Each one
// evaluates exactly ONE module today -- itself -- because its metadata is inline, its contract
// imports are `import type` (erased), and every implementation loads through a function-scoped
// `await import`. That is precisely ADR-0019's "metadata-eager and implementation-lazy" property,
// and a single static value import would silently destroy it while every other gate stayed green:
// R3/R13 govern import DIRECTION (may this file reach that one at all), never evaluation WEIGHT.
//
// Entry files are repo-root-relative, and are the KEYS of the two records below. Keying by path
// is what makes a duplicate row unwritable rather than merely discouraged: a repeated key in an
// object literal is a TypeScript error (ts1117), so the "exactly one row per entry" claim is
// enforced by the compiler instead of by a runtime check that a `Set` conversion would hide.

/**
 * A bounded account of WHERE an entry's evaluated modules come from: its heaviest direct imports,
 * each with a couple of representative routes into what they pull in.
 *
 * What it shows: the entry's direct edges ranked by how many modules enter the closure THROUGH
 * THEM -- attribution by shortest import route, since the walk is breadth-first -- capped, with
 * the omitted counts stated. When a regression is a new import on the entry itself, which is the
 * common case, that edge is new and everything under it is attributed to it, so it sorts to the
 * top and the offending route is the first thing printed.
 *
 * What it does NOT show: a diff against a recorded baseline. This gate persists each entry's
 * module COUNT, not its module identity, so it cannot say "these three modules are new" -- only
 * "these edges account for the weight". A regression added deep inside an already-large subtree
 * is therefore attributed to the top-level edge containing it, not to the exact file that changed.
 * Naming the true delta would mean checking in ~1,500 module paths and rewriting them on every
 * contracts refactor; the count plus this attribution was judged the better trade. Reconstruct an
 * exact delta when you need one by running the walker on the merge base.
