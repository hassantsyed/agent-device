/**
 * The caller-side half of the replay script source bundle (#1802): the CLI,
 * the Node client, and the MCP tools all reach the daemon through the replay
 * command family's daemon writers, and every one of them builds its bundle
 * here — there is no separate remote path, so "works locally, ENOENT in CI"
 * cannot come back.
 *
 * Reading is the caller's job because only the caller has the files. That also
 * moves the "no such script" failure to where the path means something: it is
 * raised against the caller's own filesystem, naming the path as typed, before
 * any daemon round-trip.
 *
 * `@agent-device/maestro` is loaded ON DEMAND, inside `loadReplayScriptSourceBundle`, and only
 * when the entry resolves to a flow. The replay command family is part of the CLI's startup import
 * closure (the command registry evaluates it for `--help` and every other invocation), and the
 * Maestro engine drags its YAML parser in with it — statically importing it here cost ~28ms on
 * every warm command and a 131 kB startup chunk. `src/__tests__/cli-startup-import-closure.test.ts`
 * holds that line; ADR 0019 and #1681/#1641 are the same rule applied to `node:http` and the help
 * fast path.
