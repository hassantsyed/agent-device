// #1824 found two causes behind `Worker exited unexpectedly`. Shape (A) — a test signalling
// a fabricated pid that landed on a sibling fork — was fixed at the source in #1854. Shape
// (B) was left open: one fork dies mid-file, alone, with no test attributed. Scanning every
// failed Coverage job across the 120 CI runs after #1854 merged found the signature five
// times, and the vanished file was this one all five (plus #1866's, so six for six) — 23% of
// Coverage failures in that window. The uninstrumented unit lane has never lost it.
//
// So the coverage run skips this project and a second, uninstrumented Vitest invocation owns
// it — see `test:coverage:ci`. That costs no coverage at all, which is measured rather than
// assumed: the cases execute out of process, which the fork's inspector session never
// instruments, so this file reports the same lines with or without it.
//
// Membership is by demonstrated failure, not by a property of the code. In particular it is
// NOT "constructs a `node:worker_threads` Worker": `session-replay-runtime-maestro.test.ts`
// does exactly that and stays in `unit-core`, instrumented and green. The proximate cause was
// never reproduced — what these entries share is an observed record of vanishing from the
// Coverage lane, and that record is the only thing that admits a file here. A new entry needs
// its own run URLs; a theory about workers is not enough.
//
// #2053: the split did not stop it — the uninstrumented second leg lost the same file six more
// times in three days. Calibrating each mechanism against this project (see the issue) showed
// that every death Node can report is reported, leaving an uncatchable signal; and the only
// thing this file did that no other file does was run adversarial parser cases inside the fork,
// on worker threads it created and terminated. They now run in a worker process
// (`scripts/fuzz/execute.ts`), where such a fault is a `crash` failure named against its input.
// This entry and the second leg it forces are the mitigation: remove both — file back to
// `unit-core`, `test:coverage:ci` back to one invocation — after 30 consecutive Coverage runs
// with no `Worker exited unexpectedly`, and reopen #2053 with the run URL if one appears first.
